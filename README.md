===========

This project is aimed to extend beans generated by XML to Java Compiler (XJC) with some useful facilities. 
Generated beans have no binary dependencies so their usage has zero cost at runtime. 
These facilities are implemented by a separate plugins.

## Fluent API plugin

XJC argument: `-Xfluent`

It provides method chaining - a flexible way of constructing beans with a big number of fields.

## Constructor plugin

XJC argument: `-Xctor`

It provides two constructors - parameterless one and a constructor with a parameter for each field.


## ToString plugin

XJC argument: `-Xstr`

It provides a toString method implementation which includes all fields into resulting string.
